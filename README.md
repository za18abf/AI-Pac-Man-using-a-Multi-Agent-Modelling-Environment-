# AI-Pac-Man-using-a-Multi-Agent-Modelling-Environment-
This project has been focused on creating an intelligent agent i.e., to bring AI properties to classic Pacman game. With this the user no longer controls the Pacman like the original concept as it works autonomously to achieve the highest score possible.

The project has been divided into 3 phase, starting with the most basic phase where the Pacman moves randomly through the map with no awareness of its surrounding at all. Second phase shows a semi intelligent pacman with pathfinding Algorithm which helps the pacman finding its way around the surroundings with more precision and awareness. The final phase brings an additional algorithm called multiagent search algorithm with increases the AI Pacman's efficiency and making all the agents work in a sync.
